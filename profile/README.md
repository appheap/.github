We are also active in other ML-related organizations like <a href="https://github.com/tensorops">TensorOps</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bi-graph/">BiGraph</a>. In TensorOps, we are mainly working on cutting-edge deep learning models and libraries like <a href="https://github.com/tensorops/TransformerX">TransformerX</a> which is aiming for providing researchers with the building blocks they need to develop their transformer-based models.

Also, we have libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/bi-graph/bigraph">Bigraph</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bi-graph/emgraph">
